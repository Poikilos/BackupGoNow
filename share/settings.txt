#How to use this file:
#--Uppercase/lowercase does not matter
#--Use "#" sign at the beginning of a line to make it a comment and it will be ignored.
#--<Save to Drive> line is the label or location of your destination drive.  If it ends in "\" "/" or ":" it will be taken
#  literally (as a location) instead of finding the drive by label (unless you have a osx or another system where ":"
#  is your folder seperator character (that will be detected and should work correctly)
#--<Save to Folder> line is your subfolder folder in the drive.
#  --(i.e. if you put "New Folder" without quotes, the data will end up in "X:\New Folder\")
#  --If you wish it to be the root of the drive, use a dot ("<targetfolder>.") instead of a regular folder name.
#--<Save to File> line is the destination file name of the backup file to save/update.
#--<Command> line is either "update" or "replace" (no quotes, capitalization doesn't matter).
#--Every following line following must be an absolute folder/file location preceded by a tag
#  "<file>", "<folder>", or "<folder ignoring subfolders>"
#	--(as many as you want, include brackets ("<" and ">") but not quotes, and leave no space between closing
#  bracket and file/folder name (i.e. "<file>backup" not "<file> backup")
#
#An example is included below (if the comments were removed, it would compress
# the files (update, not replace):

#<Save to Drive>FLASH1
#<Save to Folder>Backup
#<Save to File>testGoNowBackup
#<Command>update
#<Folder>C:\Documents and Settings\Owner\My Documents\Projects\GoNowBackup\bin\etc\test1
#<Folder ignoring subfolders>C:\Documents and Settings\Owner\My Documents\Projects\GoNowBackup\bin\etc\test2
#<File>C:\Documents and Settings\Owner\My Documents\Projects\GoNowBackup\bin\etc\test3.txt

#Type your commands below or uncomment the appropriate lines above.

<Save to Drive>MEMOREX
<Save to Folder>.
<Save to File>NetBoxBackup
<Command>update
<Folder>C:\Documents and Settings\Owner\Application Data\Thunderbird
