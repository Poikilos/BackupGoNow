# 2017-08-03 Moving to Version Control
Migrating from manual backups to GitHub commits

## Changes to all versions:
* Made format and name of README.md files uniform and include known changes that were not previously noted
* Deleted profiles, computer-specific data, old batch installer, and other extra files from bin (left some of these things in ownCloud)
* Moved deprecated files to deprecated folder when deprecated
	* moved linux folder (a collection of old scripts not working recently) in root of each version to deprecated
* Deleted obj folder in root of each version
* renamed bin to bin-redist since bin is default build location and therefore is in gitignore\
* made "Backup GoNow.requires-flister-and-chunker.zip" into a commit: 2010-02-10 (added profiles)
* retroactively added known changes from later README files back into README of version 2010-02-10 and onward
* retroactively changed license of every version to GPL v3
* for each version:
rm "Backup GoNow in bin.*lnk"
rm "Backup GoNow.requires-flister-and-chunker.zip"
rm "clean cache - Shortcut.*lnk"
rm "FolderLister src.*lnk"
#(copy PDF to owncloud then)

rm "install.bat in redistributable.*lnk"
rm "UniWinForms src.*lnk"
rm "install*.bat"

* change "Copyright (c)" to "Authors: " in all versions of README
* accumulate changes to README.md file of each version
* accumulate release notes that were in install.bat and place in README.md file of each related version
	* first changelog was found in 2012-05-21; however, 2017-04-14 readme was missing some stuff from that previous one so has now been added to the later one; versions between those had no changes (except 2017-07-12, so known Changes have now been noted
